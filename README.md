This is the Module 3 challenge for Python. It is completed according to the instructions provided on BootCampSpot.

The challenge is split up into two folders: PyBank and PyPoll. Each folder is composed of an Analysis and Resources folder, in addition to the main python code file. The Analysis folder contains the text file with the written analysis, while the Resources folder contains the CSV file with the data used.

I had used this resource to help me figure out how to successfully write into text files:

I committed and pushed changes to github a couple of times, but in the future I should make more commits and pushes for the sake of safety.

The python file for each challenge is hopefully satisfactorily commented.

Happy 2023!
